  description: "Modular architecture design serves as a fundamental strategy to manage the complexity of engineering systems by decomposing them into independent, manageable units. While traditional approaches prioritize minimizing inter-module interactions for development efficiency, this research expands the optimization scope to the entire system lifecycle. We focus on integrating diverse downstream considerations---such as procurement and manufacturing---into the architectural decision-making process to derive modular designs that maximize total system value."

  caption: "Overview of the conceptual design framework for launch vehicles."
  description: "Launch vehicle conceptual design requires a multidisciplinary optimization approach, particularly addressing the strong coupling between stage sizing and trajectory design. While optimal staging minimizes lift-off mass by allocating structural and propellant distributions, trajectory optimization maximizes payload delivery by managing ascent velocity losses. This research focuses on the simultaneous optimization of these interconnected elements to determine the most efficient launch vehicle configuration and flight path."
