# Hi, I’m Jaewoo Kim.

I’m a PhD student in [KAIST](https://kaist.ac.kr/en/) at the Department of Aerospace Engineering and a member of the [Strategic Aerospace Initiative](http://sai.kaist.ac.kr), advised by Professor Jaemyung Ahn.

My research focuses on making outer space economically more accessible by developing realistic mathematical models of various space systems and conducting quantitative analysis.

Through my research, I aim to explore innovative ways to make space utilization more efficient, sustainable, and beneficial for humanity.

I enjoy meeting new people, engaging in group activities, visiting art museums, and watching documentaries about various topics in my free time.

I’m always eager to learn new things and expand my horizons.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you :)
