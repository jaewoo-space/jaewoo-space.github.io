### Hi, I’m Jaewoo Kim.

I’m a PhD student in [Korea Advance Institute of Science and Technology](https://kaist.ac.kr/en/) at the Department of Aerospace Engineering and a member of the [Strategic Aerospace Initiative](http://sai.kaist.ac.kr), advised by Professor Jaemyung Ahn. 

My academic interest is on exploring innovative ways to make space utilization more beneficial and sustainable. I specifically address critical issues affecting the value of space systems throughout their lifecycle, with a focus on optimization techniques to identify better solutions.

Beyond academia, I enjoy meeting new people, engaging in group activities, visiting art museums, and watching documentaries about various topics.

I’m always eager to learn new things and expand my horizons.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you :)
