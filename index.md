### Hi, I’m Jaewoo Kim.

I’m a Ph.D. student at the [Korea Advance Institute of Science and Technology](https://kaist.ac.kr/en/) in the Department of Aerospace Engineering and a member of the [Strategic Aerospace Initiative](http://sai.kaist.ac.kr), advised by Professor Jaemyung Ahn. 

My academic interest is exploring innovative ways to make space utilization more beneficial and sustainable. I specifically address critical issues affecting the value of space systems throughout their lifecycle, focusing on optimization techniques to identify better solutions.

Other than academia, I enjoy meeting new people, engaging in group activities, visiting art museums, and watching documentaries about various topics.

I’m always eager to learn new things and expand my horizons.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you :)
